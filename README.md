# Does Health LLC Pill Despenser Simulator
I can probably create a virtual version of the does health pill dispenser. The main pro of this approach is that you can write tests for the server application which interact with the pill dispenser in complex ways and you'll be able to ensure the pill dispenser responds correctly in those situations.

For ease of use I will build this in the same folder and Express application as the server code simulator. To allow both applications to coexist I'll just put them at different routes and include links to both in the navigation bar.

# Dose Health LLC Server Code
Does Health LLC must have a server application or something else which can help you interact with the pill dispenser. I assume the server application must:
* Have a screen where you can view a patient's pills they need to take, the dosage amounts, and the frequency of the pills. For instance, "John Doe" may have 3 prescriptions. One is dispensed every day at 1pm and 3pm. The other is dispensed every other day at 6am and 6pm. The final pill is dispensed once a week on Monday. This information should have a read-only view and an Edit view, and you should be able to remove dispense lines and delete the entire patient.
* Have a screen where you can view all pills which need to be dispensed for a given day, like Monday the 3rd of March.

# Want-To-Haves
* It would be nice if the application ran in AWS, and...
* It would be nice if the application was accessible at a human-readable website or subdomain while it is running in the cloud.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
